# This script is intended to simplify the process of adding Intelligent Tiering Lifecycle Policies 
# to S3 buckets for all objects >128KB. See https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/intelligent-tiering/ for
# details on Intelligent Tiering for S3 Buckets. 
# The Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier when access patterns change. 
# For a small monthly object monitoring and automation charge, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects that have not been accessed to lower cost access tiers. 
# S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. 
# You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for data lakes, analytics, and new applications.

# If an LC policy exist,  the script checks if it has a transition policy (with a StorageClass such as Glacier, S3-Infrequent access or even S3-Intelligent Tiering or others). 
# If the transition policy does not exist, the script will add a new policy to the existing policy with the transition set for the Current and Previous version to the INT StorageClass with “0” days using createLCP(Name) 
# and records the action in the global list variable - TransitionStatus with the status = 'updated existing LC Policy'
#Scenario #2
# If an LC policy exist and has a transition policy (to move to a different StorageClass such as Glacier, S3-Infrequent access or others), the script  records its action action in the excel sheet and take no action on the LC policy.
# It just records - transition storage and days to transition in the global list variable - TransitionStatus with the status = 'No Changes LC Policy'
# Scenario #3
#   If no LC policy is attached to the bucket, the script adds a new policy with the transition set for the Current and Previous version to the INT StorageClass with “0” days. 
# It records its action in the excel sheet in the global list variable with the TransitionStatus = 'Added LC Policy'
